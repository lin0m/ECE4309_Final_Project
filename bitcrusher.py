Description:    BitCrusher Virus
                A self-replicating virus that infects other python scripts. It
                infects the entire directory tree in aIt takes malicious
                code and injects it at the beginning of the main function of 
                other python scripts.

Comment on Main Function:
The main function was removed to avoid dealing with adjusting
indentation when copying the virus into other scripts. Instead,
all the functions are explicitly called at the bottom. Although
the indendation adjustment code worked, any change to the code 
changed the line number of the main function, meaning we had to 
constatnly change the code that adjusted indentation.
